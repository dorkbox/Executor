Shell Executor
==============

Shell and JVM command execution on Linux, MacOS, or Windows for Java 6+.

 
Ironically, there are a considerable number of 'gotchas' when launching shell/JVM processes via Java. This library solves problems with:
1. Redirecting in/out/err streams correctly
1. Enabling single-character input
1. Correctly reading out/err process output streams to prevent memory issues.

- This is for cross-platform use, specifically - linux 32/64, mac 32/64, and windows 32/64. Java 6+
